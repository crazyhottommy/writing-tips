# writing tips

I am taking a a series of writing classes at MD Anderson Cancer Center taught by [Dr.Mark Picus](https://gsbs.uth.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/faculty-profiles.htm?id=2851994)  
He is a great teacher of knowledge and houmor. I love his classes and I want to put the key things that I have leraned here.  

#### writing 1  
1. Here are some qualities of a good title of a paper:  
* It has the most important key words relevant to the paper.  
* It conveys the key ideas of the paper.  
* It is specific.  

2. Simple rules to write an easy to understand paragraph:  
* Put the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.  
* State the topic as the subject of the first main clause.  
* Subordinate less important ideas to ones that directly support the topic sentence.  
* **Repeat** key terms.  
* Put information that is new to the reader into a framwork of information already known to the reader.  

3. Paragraph development.  
* Exemplification  
* Enumeration  
* Description 
* Definition  
* Classification & Division 
* Narration
* Process
* Analysis
* Comparison & Contrast
* Cause & Effect


4. Writing checklist:  
* Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?  
    + where is it?  
* Are key words from the topic sentence repeated(including clear synonyms) throughout the paragraph?  
* Does the topic sentence give the reader an idea of the structure of the paragraph?  
    + Does the paragraph have aclear structure?  
    + If the paragraph is a mixture of organizational forms, what is the main form?  
* Is the topic the focus of every (or most) of the setences in each paragraph?  
    + Are less important ideas subordinated to the topic idea of the paragraph?  
    + Are coordinated ideas truly equal?

#### Writing 2    

1. We should try to put given (old) information **BEFORE** new information in a sentence.  
2. Place TOPICAL INFORMATION in SUBJECT POSITION. In other words, when there are a number of noun phrases in a sentence that
include GIVEN information, choose the noun phrase that states the TOPIC of the paragraph ofr the subject of the sentence if
at all possible.
