# writing tips

I am taking a a series of writing classes at MD Anderson Cancer Center taught by [Dr.Mark Picus](https://gsbs.uth.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/faculty-profiles.htm?id=2851994)  
He is a great teacher of knowledge and humor. I love his classes and I want to put the key things that I have leraned here.  

#### writing 1  
* Here are some qualities of a good title of a paper:
    + It has the most important key words relevant to the paper.  
    + It conveys the key ideas of the paper.  
    + It is specific.  

* Simple rules to write an easy to understand paragraph:  
    + Put the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.  
    + State the topic as the subject of the first main clause.  
    + Subordinate less important ideas to ones that directly support the topic sentence.  
    + **Repeat** key terms.
    + Put information that is new to the reader into a framwork of information already known to the reader.  

* Paragraph development.
    + Exemplification  
    + Enumeration  
    + Description 
    + Definition  
    + Classification & Division
    + Narration
    + Process
    + Analysis
    + Comparison & Contrast
    + Cause & Effect
    
* Writing checklist:  
    + Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?  
    + where is it?
    + Are key words from the topic sentence repeated(including clear synonyms) throughout the paragraph?  
    + Does the topic sentence give the reader an idea of the structure of the paragraph?  
    + Does the paragraph have aclear structure?  
    + If the paragraph is a mixture of organizational forms, what is the main form?  
    + Is the topic the focus of every (or most) of the setences in each paragraph?  
    + Are less important ideas subordinated to the topic idea of the paragraph?  
    + Are coordinated ideas truly equal?

#### Writing 2    

* We should try to put given (old) information **BEFORE** new information in a sentence.  
* Place TOPICAL INFORMATION in SUBJECT POSITION. In other words, when there are a number of noun phrases in a sentence that
include GIVEN information, choose the noun phrase that states the TOPIC of the paragraph ofr the subject of the sentence if
at all possible.   


### Writing 3

* [Ajective Clauses](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/writing-tips/blob/master/Restrictive.and.Nonrestrictive.adjective.clauses.md)  restrictive and Non-restrictive clauses. when to use `that`, when to use `which`:


| A Restrictive Adjective Clause:                                                                                                    | A Nonrestrictive Adjective Clause:                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| identifies the noun it is referring to; without the adjective clause, the reader will not know which thing or person the noun is.  | provides additional information about the noun it is referring to, but the clause is not necessary in order for the reader to know which person or thing the noun is. |
| is written without commas.                                                                                                         | is written with commas.                                                                                                                                               |
| may use any relative pronoun including that.                                                                                       | may not use the relative pronoun that.                                                                                                                                |
| does not usually refer to a proper noun (but it can in special circumstances.)                                                     | may refer to a proper or common noun.                                                                                                                                 |
| may refer to a noun with a generic determiner (every, any, some, no or none).                                                      | may not refer to a noun with a generic determiner, except for some.                                                                                                   |
| can only refer to a noun, not to an idea                                                                                           | can refer to a noun or an idea.                                                                                                                                       |
[proper noun vs common noun](http://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/proper-nouns.html)  

proper noun names **specific** people, place, things or ideas: Mike, Paris, Nike.
common noun names **non-specific** people, place, things or ideas: woman, city, dog, shore.

Most of the nous followed by adjective clauses with commas (non-restrictive) are proper nouns, while most of the nouns followed by adjective clauses without commas (restrictive) are common nouns. **what is important here is not whether the nouns are proper or common, but rather what the reader knows about the nouns and what the adjective clauses tell the reader about the nouns.** 

Let's see an example:

| original sentence                                                                                                                                                                              | take out the adjective clause                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. The Amazon rain forest, where much of the world’s oxygen is produced, is currently threatened by development. But Brazil has other forests which are even more endangered than the Amazon.  | 2. The Amazon rain forest is currently threatened by development. But Brazil has other forests.  |



>The example on the left is very clear. The reader is introduced to the Amazon rain forest and
then to Brazil’s other forests, and a comparison is made between the two forests. However, the
example on the right is not so clear. There is no problem with the first sentence. If the adjective
clause is taken out, the sentence is still clear. The adjective clause where much of the world’s
oxygen is produced simply gives additional information about the Amazon rain forest, but that
information is not necessary in order to understand the paragraph.

>However, in the second sentence, the adjective clause which are even more endangered than the
Amazon gives us some very important information. That information tells us exactly which other
forests the author is referring to and explains the relationship between these other forests and the
Amazon, and this relationship is very important for understanding the paragraph. Without that
adjective clause, a reader might think that the other Brazilian forests referred to are not
endangered and therefore we don’t need to worry about the Amazon, but that isn’t what the
author wants to tell us.

| original sentence                                                                                                                                                        | take out the adjective clause                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3. Experts, who are working in the Atlantic Forest, say it will take at least 50 more years before the Atlantic Forest appears again in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  | 4. Experts who are working in the Atlantic Forest say it will take at least 50 more years before the Atlantic Forest appears again in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. |

>In the sentence on the left, the writer assumes that the reader knows exactly which experts he is
referring to. Probably, a previous sentence has already mentioned these experts, so the reference
is clear. In the sentence on the right, the noun experts can refer to every expert in every field of
study. In order to make it clear which experts are being referred to, a restrictive adjective clause is
used to make it clear to the reader: only those experts who are working in the Atlantic Forest. 

| original sentence                                                                                             | take out the adjective clause                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5. My brother, who is a cattle rancher in Brazil, has contributed to the destruction of the Atlantic Forest.  | 6. My brother who is a cattle rancher in Brazil has contributed to the destruction of the Atlantic Forest.  |

>These adjective clauses can actually give information about the author, even if we don’t know
the author at all. In the sentence on the left, we can assume that the author has only one brother.
How can we know that? The adjective clause is nonrestrictive; therefore, we can take it out of the
sentence and still understand who the noun is referring to. If the author writes “My brother has
contributed to the destruction of the Atlantic Forest,” we can assume that the author only has one
brother; otherwise, the author would probably need to identify the brother more completely by
using a restrictive adjective clause. In the sentence on the right, the adjective clause is identifying
the brother. It is telling us which brother is contributing to the destruction of the forest. Since that
is necessary information, we can assume that the author has more than one brother. 

**Tips:**

* What THING or IDEA is the sentence about? Put this at the story point (subject position).
* what information do I want to EMPHASIZE? put his at the point of emphasis (near the end of the sentence.)
* How close are the story point (subject) and the point of emphasis(object)?  Can I get them closer?
* underline the subject of every sentence. Are the subjects coherent? Are the subjects telling the same story?

### Verbs

verbs<-- Action verb and Linking verb  
Action verb<-- transitive (followed by an object) and intransitive (no-object)  

**It is possible for a verb to be both transitive and intransitive:**  
We **grew** small preps of selected E. coli colonies in the lab.   
E. coli colonies **grow** quickly under the right conditions.    


There are not many linking verbs in English, and they are easy to remember:    
**Group 1 – be, become, get, turn**  
I was a teacher; I became a biomedical researcher, but I got lazy and turned Republican, and now I live under the freeway.  

**Group 2 – look, sound, smell, taste, feel (verbs of sensation)**  
The tumor looks smaller, the patient sounds and feels good, the hospital room smells 
fresh, but the food here tastes terrible.  

**Group 3 – seem, appear, grow, remain, stay, prove**  
The students seem happy, and they appear content. They grow smarter day by day, and they remain satisfied with their course of study. I’m sure they will stay cheerful while at MD Anderson, and their experience here will prove worthwhile.

Use Noun or adjective after Linking verb.  

Many linking verbs can also be action verbs:  
The oncologist suddenly **appeared** in the patient’s room with good news.
