# writing tips

I am taking a a series of writing classes at MD Anderson Cancer Center taught by [Dr.Mark Picus](https://gsbs.uth.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/faculty-profiles.htm?id=2851994)  
He is a great teacher of knowledge and humor. I love his classes and I want to put the key things that I have leraned here.  

#### writing 1  
* Here are some qualities of a good title of a paper:
    + It has the most important key words relevant to the paper.  
    + It conveys the key ideas of the paper.  
    + It is specific.  

* Simple rules to write an easy to understand paragraph:  
    + Put the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.  
    + State the topic as the subject of the first main clause.  
    + Subordinate less important ideas to ones that directly support the topic sentence.  
    + **Repeat** key terms.
    + Put information that is new to the reader into a framwork of information already known to the reader.  

* Paragraph development.
    + Exemplification  
    + Enumeration  
    + Description 
    + Definition  
    + Classification & Division
    + Narration
    + Process
    + Analysis
    + Comparison & Contrast
    + Cause & Effect
    
* Writing checklist:  
    + Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?  
    + where is it?
    + Are key words from the topic sentence repeated(including clear synonyms) throughout the paragraph?  
    + Does the topic sentence give the reader an idea of the structure of the paragraph?  
    + Does the paragraph have aclear structure?  
    + If the paragraph is a mixture of organizational forms, what is the main form?  
    + Is the topic the focus of every (or most) of the setences in each paragraph?  
    + Are less important ideas subordinated to the topic idea of the paragraph?  
    + Are coordinated ideas truly equal?

#### Writing 2    

* We should try to put given (old) information **BEFORE** new information in a sentence.  
* Place TOPICAL INFORMATION in SUBJECT POSITION. In other words, when there are a number of noun phrases in a sentence that
include GIVEN information, choose the noun phrase that states the TOPIC of the paragraph ofr the subject of the sentence if
at all possible.   


### Writing 3

* [Ajective Clauses](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/writing-tips/blob/master/Restrictive.and.Nonrestrictive.adjective.clauses.md)  restrictive and Non-restrictive clauses. when to use `that`, when to use `which`:


| A Restrictive Adjective Clause:                                                                                                    | A Nonrestrictive Adjective Clause:                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| identifies the noun it is referring to; without the adjective clause, the reader will not know which thing or person the noun is.  | provides additional information about the noun it is referring to, but the clause is not necessary in order for the reader to know which person or thing the noun is. |
| is written without commas.                                                                                                         | is written with commas.                                                                                                                                               |
| may use any relative pronoun including that.                                                                                       | may not use the relative pronoun that.                                                                                                                                |
| does not usually refer to a proper noun (but it can in special circumstances.)                                                     | may refer to a proper or common noun.                                                                                                                                 |
| may refer to a noun with a generic determiner (every, any, some, no or none).                                                      | may not refer to a noun with a generic determiner, except for some.                                                                                                   |
| can only refer to a noun, not to an idea                                                                                           | can refer to a noun or an idea.                                                                                                                                       |

**Tips:**

* What THING or IDEA is the sentence about? Put this at the story point (subject position).
* what information do I want to EMPHASIZE? put his at the point of emphasis (near the end of the sentence.)
* How close are the story point (subject) and the point of emphasis(object)?  Can I get them closer?
* underline the subject of every sentence. Are the subjects coherent? Are the subjects telling the same story?
